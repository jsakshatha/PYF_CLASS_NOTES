    "According to the Wikipedia, In probability theory and statistics,** Bayes’s theorem** (alternatively *Bayes’s law* or *Bayes’s rule*) describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.\n",
    "Mathematically, it can be written as:\n",

    "* P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of observing A and B respectively; they are known as the marginal probability.\n"
